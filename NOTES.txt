Pub.getInstance() had a fairly critical bug (tables were created in the Pub constructor, but the tables themselves used Pub.getInstance which in some [lots] of cases would create another pub that would screw up the entire simulation). We fixed this a few hours after submission, so this submission at least is working properly.

In addition to that, we solved the issue of missing glasses and cups (customers were heaving their container, which I found a bit funny…).

As a final note: the code have not been refactored as much as was requested in our rejection comments (classical mistake of one only one person having the updated code during exam week [meaning we both are impossible to get a hold of]). To buy more time, I submitted in panic before the deadline.

To avoid you having to spend too much time trying to find out what have been changed (as this is more of a “half” submission) I’ve attached a diff of the changed code, as well as the .git folder if you would rather inspect the changes yourself.

The diff file is the one named CHANGES.diff.

PS: The reason we don’t have a lot of processes is that we fire them (e.g. main_loop) manually from the constructors.
